# afwf-jar-lib-generator

## Instruction:
1. Connect Amazfit Stratos to your computer
2. Open `afwf-jar-lib-generator.exe` (Downloaded from [release](https://github.com/amoshydra/afwf-jar-lib-generator/releases/latest))
3. Look for `./output/HuamiWatchFaces2.jar`


## Notes:
This script should work for Amazfit Pace too (but it has only been tested with Stratos as of now)
